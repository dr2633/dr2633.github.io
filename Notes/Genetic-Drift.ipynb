    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is **irreducible** if it is possible to get from any state to any other state in a finite number of steps. This means that for any pair of states $i$ and $j$ in the state space $S$, there exists some positive integer $n$ such that the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ in $n$ steps is greater than zero:\n",

    "#### 2. Aperiodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is **aperiodic** if it does not get \"stuck\" in cycles of fixed length. Formally, the period of a state $i$ is defined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the number of steps $n$ required to return to state $i$:\n",
