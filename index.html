    <h3>Academic and Professional Interests</h3>
    <p>My work is at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and AI safety. I develop deep learning models to analyze neural and speech data, focusing on aligning embeddings in artificial neural networks with time-resolved recordings of neural activity to improve our understanding of how the brain processes auditory and language information </p>

    <p>I create and share tutorials on core concepts in computational biology and computer science, making my work accessible within the broader research community. With research foundations in computational neuroscience, my current focus is in AI safety, model evaluations, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). </p>

    <p>My goal is to develop AI systems that are interpretable, reliable, and aligned to promote human values and scientific progress. I view these twin objectives as intrinsically connected and mutually reinforcing.</p>

    <h3>Research and Career Focus</h3>

    <p>I am driven by the challenge of aligning AI systems with human values and user objectives.</p>

    <p>More specifically, I am developing techniques for eliciting preferences from both models and users, which I see as critical for both the safe and ethical deployment of AI, as well as optimizing performance in real-world applications.</p>

    <p>I have developed a model evaluation framework for eliciting and evaluating model preferences in integrations with cloud service providers (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.).</p>

    <p>You can find the CloudPref evaluation framework on my GitHub repository here:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/dr2633/CloudPref-METR" target="_blank">Cloud Service Provider Preferences: Evaluating LLM Integrations</a>.



    <p>My background in policy and international relations complements my technical work, allowing me to evaluate not only model capabilities, but also the societal impact once deployed.</p>

    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>

    <p><strong>Random Walks Through Libraries and Bookstores</strong><br>
    I enjoy random walks through the stacks of historic libraries, finding my way towards new books and ideas. <br>
    Personal Favorite: <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/tour/ADWhiteReadingRoom">Uris Library</a>, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY</p>

    <p>

    <p><strong>Travel and Live Music</strong><br>

    I love exploring new venues for live music, particularly the music of the Grateful Dead. <br>
    Check out recordings here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead">Grateful Dead Archive</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Long-Horizon Predictions</strong><br>
I am working towards a world where intelligent systems increasingly make critical decisions in our lives and in determining policies. <br>
My focus is ensuring that this future world remains vibrant, exciting, and filled with opportunities for future generations.</p>

<p>While I focus on these long-term outcomes, there are three primary near-term goals in sight:<br>
    1. New York Jets winning a Super Bowl (Rodgers holding a Lombardi trophy)<br>
    2. New York Knicks securing an NBA championship (Brunson gets a statue)<br>
    3. Secure deployment of AGI (Ilya achieves safe and secure superintelligence)</p>

<p>I’m open to friendly wagers on which of these events we’ll see first!</p>
