        <p>Dear [Hiring Manager or Team Name],</p>

        <p>My background in AI safety and model evaluations, along with experience in psychology and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has equipped me to contribute to OpenAI’s mission by developing systems that align AI behavior with user values and safety principles. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective from my research in computational neuroscience and behavioral science, where I have explored the alignment of neural data with AI models, providing insights into the cognitive processes underlying human-AI interaction.</p>

        <p>In this role, I am excited to explore new methods for eliciting user preferences and developing protocols for evaluating human reward functions based on model queries. By leveraging my skills in RLHF, I aim to refine how AI systems interpret and adapt to user feedback, fostering trust, reliability, and a deeper alignment between AI systems and human values. A key aspect of this work will involve automating the data pipeline from model evaluations to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improvements, and I am well-equipped to analyze large datasets, contribute to annotations, refine model outputs, and scale evaluations across diverse user groups.</p>

        <p>I am also adept at communicating complex AI use cases to enterprise clients, helping them leverage proprietary data for custom RAG solutions. My experience includes developing tutorials and partnering with businesses to integrate LLMs, as demonstrated in my work on evaluating LLM integrations with cloud service providers. I believe this background positions me to add significant value in guiding enterprise clients to maximize the impact of OpenAI’s deployed models and suite of applications.</p>

        <p>I look forward to contributing to OpenAI’s mission and am available to start as soon as possible, with a preferred start date of November 4th. For more details about my work and research background, please feel free to visit my website: <a href="https://dr2633.github.io" target="_blank">https://dr2633.github.io</a>.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,<br>
        Derek Rosenzweig</p>
