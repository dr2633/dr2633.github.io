    <h1>From General Intelligence to Grounded Solutions</h1>
    <h4>Principle 1: Each definition should be grounded in a distribution of data.</h4>

    <h2>Introduction and Definition</h2>
    <p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) often centers on developing systems that can mimic, match, and ultimately surpass human reasoning and problem-solving across a wide range of tasks and benchmarks. But a truly transformative AGI will do more than emulate human thought—it will <strong>convert well-defined queries into verifiable, actionable outcomes that can be realized in the physical world</strong>. This focus on physical realizability emphasizes the need for AGI to translate complex questions into concrete solutions that produce measurable impact.</p>

    <h4>Principle 2: The more precise a query, the more actionable the output.</h4>

    <h2>A Collaborative Approach: Human and Model Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The real challenge of this decade lies in bridging the gap between computational understanding—intelligent behavior in the world of bits—and real-world execution—actions in the space of atoms. Achieving this will require close collaboration between humans and models, with both parties sharing responsibilities to ensure safety, transparency, and effective outcomes. This relationship can be thought of as a kind of <strong>fiduciary agreement</strong>, where users and model providers work together to achieve the best possible results.</p>
    <p>By clearly defining these roles, we can ensure that the next generation of more capable models is aligned with human needs and capable of solving complex, real-world problems. This approach shifts the focus from merely surpassing human cognitive abilities to building systems that produce tangible, beneficial outcomes through a partnership between human insight and machine intelligence.</p>

    <h3>User Responsibility: Well-Defined, Measurable Queries</h3>
    <p>A well-defined query is <strong>physically-grounded</strong> and <strong>experimentally-verifiable</strong>. It must aim to produce solutions applicable to real-world situations and be achievable within physical and material constraints.</p>
    <p>Unlike abstract or philosophical inquiries—such as achieving world peace or global security—a well-defined query proposes tasks that are instantiated in the physical environment. Examples include designing a protein for a specific function or planning the procurement of a rare material for manufacturing. These tasks require clear criteria and constraints, and successful implementation can be measured and refined through iteration.</p>
    <p>To ensure that these well-defined queries lead to effective outcomes, <strong>models must take on the responsibility of delivering verifiable solutions</strong>. This involves not just providing answers but ensuring that their outputs can be tested and validated through real-world actions, creating a feedback loop that continuously improves performance and reliability.</p>

    <h4>Principle 3: If the outcome is not measurable, do not expect to get there.</h4>

    <h3>Model Responsibility: Delivering Verifiable Solutions</h3>
    <p>For a model to be reliable, its outputs must be <strong>verifiable</strong>—they must produce results that can be empirically tested and implemented. A proposed solution should not merely sound plausible; it must be measurable and testable through real-world actions.</p>
    <p>For example, if a model suggests a method for synthesizing a new material, it should generate a step-by-step process that scientists can follow in a lab. Each step should yield testable results, verifying the model’s reasoning and improving the efficiency of experimentation. Feedback from these tests should be quickly provided to the model, creating an iterative loop that refines future outputs and generates new hypotheses.</p>
    <p>Early examples of this cycle include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08468">code generation</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15626">theorem-proving</a>, where outputs are validated through implementation and ground-truth axioms. By 2025, the benefits of this approach will become increasingly evident in <a href="https://www.futurehouse.org/">scientific research</a>, though it remains underutilized in policy and corporate research—fields that could greatly benefit from <strong>grounding proposals in verifiable steps</strong> to ensure the effective use of public and private funds.</p>

    <h3>Physical Realizability: From Text to Actionable Solutions</h3>
    <p>AGI's responsibility is to translate conceptual answers into practical solutions that address user queries—often provided in natural language, though this may evolve as users begin querying models with more complex datasets. This means not just providing information but offering actionable steps that can be implemented with current human or machine capabilities. These steps must align with human goals and comply with legal standards within a given jurisdiction.</p>

    <h4>Principle 4: We are only as good as the feedback we receive.</h4>

    <h3>Practical Applications of Grounded AGI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein or Material Design</strong>: AGI can predict the structure of a novel protein tailored for a specific function, such as binding to a target molecule, and generate precise steps for synthesizing it in a lab. This process is well-defined (the protein’s function is clear) and verifiable (the protein can be synthesized and tested experimentally).</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement of a Product</strong>: When tasked with sourcing a specific type of rare earth metal, AGI can identify suppliers, evaluate availability, compare prices, and draft logistics plans for transport. This is well-defined (specific metal, cost constraints) and verifiable (success is measured by the actual procurement and integration into the production process).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ambiguous queries like <em>world peace</em>, <em>human happiness</em>, or <em>political stability</em> fall outside this scope. These goals lack concrete physical instantiation, and their success cannot be empirically verified. They involve subjective interpretations and complex societal dynamics that make them unsuitable for a physically grounded approach to intelligence.</p>

    <h4>Principle 5: Ambiguity is the surest path to subtle misalignment.</h4>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Rather than focusing on a narrow definition of AGI that aims to match or surpass the perceptual and motor capacities of humans, it is more important to build tools that can integrate feedback—tangible data collected from real-world interactions.</p>
    <p>This means developing models that can anticipate human needs, generate actionable steps, produce measurable outcomes, and iterate on experiments to refine their hypotheses. The goal is to bridge abstract reasoning with material impact. By focusing on physically grounded solutions, we can provide a clearer path forward for AGI—one that emphasizes real-world impact over abstract ideals.</p>
