### Personal Interests 

**Live Music**

I enjoy exploring new venues and experiencing live music, particularly the music of the Grateful Dead. You can explore my favorite shows from the archive here: [Grateful Dead Archive](#).

**Libraries**

An avid fan of libraries, I especially enjoy taking random walks through historic libraries and stumbling upon interesting books.

### Life Goals

- Prepare for a world in which we defer most important decisions in life to systems with more intelligence and predictive capacity than the combined efforts of all humans.
- Ensure that world is vibrant and filled with opportunity for future generations.
- Live to see the New York Jets win a Super Bowl and the New York Knicks win a championship. Open for friendly bets on which of these events will happen first.
