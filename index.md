## Personal Interests 

### Live Music

I enjoy exploring new venues and experiencing live music, particularly the music of the Grateful Dead. Attached are some favorite shows from the archiveâ€”an open-access resource for live recordings that functions similarly to arXiv. This platform provides key information about the recordings, annotations, and opportunities for fans to contribute additional context about each show. You can explore the archive here: [Grateful Dead Archive](#).

### Libraries

I am an avid fan of libraries and especially enjoy taking random walks through historic libraries and stumbling upon interesting books.

**Favorite Library**: Uris Library | Cornell University | Ithaca, NY

### Life Goals

- Prepare for a world in which we defer most important decisions in life to systems with more intelligence and predictive capacity than the combined efforts of all humans.
- Ensure that world is as vibrant and filled with opportunity for future generations.
- Live to see the New York Jets win a Super Bowl and the New York Knicks win a championship. Open for friendly bets on which of these events will happen first.
