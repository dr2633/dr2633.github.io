### Research Interests

**Mechanistic Interpretability**

Applications of sparse autoencoders to identify non-trivial features in biological signals.

**Integrating Recording Modalities**

Techniques for aligning measurements across fMRI, EEG, and action potentials, enhancing interpretability of speech decoding models.

**Text Transcription of Biological Signals**

Developing frameworks to transcribe biological signals into text for model inputs and steerability.

**Policy Design and Implementation**

Leveraging insights from neural networks to inform adaptable policy development and implementation.

### Personal Interests 

**Live Music**

I love traveling and exploring new venues for live music, particularly the music of the Grateful Dead. 

Check out recordings here: [Grateful Dead Archive](https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead).

**Random Walks Through Libraries**

I enjoy random walks through the stacks of historic libraries, finding my way towards new books and ideas.

Personal Favorite: [Uris Library](https://www.cornell.edu/tour/ADWhiteReadingRoom), Cornell University, Ithaca, NY


**Long-Horizon Predictions**

I am working in preparation for a world in which we defer most important life decisions to intelligent systems with more capabilities and agency that the combined efforts of all humans. 

My goal is to ensure that this world is vibrant, exciting, and filled with opportunities for future generations that we currently can't conceive of today. 

I would like to see the New York Jets win a Super Bowl and the New York Knicks put up a championship banner at MSG, 

Open for friendly bets on which of these events will happen first.
