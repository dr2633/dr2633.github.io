## Biography

I am a researcher in computational neuroscience and machine learning. My focus is in developing algorithms for speech decoding in neural recordings as part of the Laboratory of Speech Neuroscience at Stanford University. 

I would like to apply the programming and research skills I have developed towards doing technical work in AI alignment and policy development.
