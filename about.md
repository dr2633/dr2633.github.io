## Biography

My current research is at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning, focused on developing algorithms for speech decoding. My work involves leveraging machine learning techniques to interpret neural data, contributing to understanding how the brain processes speech and language.

I am transitioning into AI alignment and policy development, aiming to develop intelligent systems attuned to the values, preferences, and limitations of users.
